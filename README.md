Allows to decrease holster delay of the minigun. In other words, decreased delay means that Heavy is able to deploy secondary/melee faster after spinning down.

```
"sm_minigun_holster_delay_override_enabled" = "1" min. 0.000000 max. 1.000000
 - If enabled, the default minigun holster delay is replaced with the value of ''sm_minigun_holster_delay_override_value''
"sm_minigun_holster_delay_override_value" = "0.4" min. 0.000000 max. 10.000000
 - Custom delay after which minigun may be holstered since it was spun down (in seconds)
```
